            <p>I have been busy building <a href="http://www.zeczec.com">zeczec</a>. This version was shipped 2 weeks ago, and I guess I’d never really be happy with it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, so evidently upon shipping zeczec, I stopped writing blogs and stopped redesigning my blog(!), which is bad, but I just could not spare the time, too many bugs and too many improvements to make. :S</p>

<p>I have been thinking about finishing the <a href="/2013/04/14/A-Story-1/">last post</a> for a long time, but having left it for too long, I cannot really find a place to start…</p>

<p>Therefore, instead of keeping finding out where and how to start, I thought I try to get back on track by redesigning my blog! :) And as expected, as soon as I open Sublime(not really, Sublime was never closed), the new design was born within 2 hours. So here it is, now the next thing would be to start writing again. Hope that would happen soon.</p>

<p>In the mean time,… I’m craving some dumplings.</p>
