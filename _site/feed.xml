        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been busy building &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeczec.com&quot;&gt;zeczec&lt;/a&gt;. This version was shipped 2 weeks ago, and I guess I’d never really be happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, so evidently upon shipping zeczec, I stopped writing blogs and stopped redesigning my blog(!), which is bad, but I just could not spare the time, too many bugs and too many improvements to make. :S&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about finishing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/04/14/A-Story-1/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; for a long time, but having left it for too long, I cannot really find a place to start…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, instead of keeping finding out where and how to start, I thought I try to get back on track by redesigning my blog! :) And as expected, as soon as I open Sublime(not really, Sublime was never closed), the new design was born within 2 hours. So here it is, now the next thing would be to start writing again. Hope that would happen soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time,… I’m craving some dumplings.&lt;/p&gt;
